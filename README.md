# ML-Using-Insider-Trading

Below is the speculative current project roadmap

Goal:
Use machine learning (via TensorFlow) to simulate stock trading decisions (on a paper account) informed by:

Market sentiment (from social media and financial news)

Political insider trading data

Company-specific and geopolitical news

üß† 1. Define the ML Task
Classification: Buy / Hold / Sell

Regression: Predict price change or return

Reinforcement Learning: Learn a trading strategy over time (e.g., DQN, PPO)

üóÇÔ∏è 2. Gather and Prepare Data
üìà Market & Stock Data
Use yfinance, Alpha Vantage, or Polygon.io to get historical OHLCV data.

python
Copy
Edit
import yfinance as yf
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2020-01-01", end="2024-12-31")
üó≥Ô∏è Political Insider Trading
Senate/House trading disclosures: Use quiverquant.com API or scrape from the Senate STOCK Act disclosures.

üì∞ News & Sentiment
Company-specific news: Use NewsAPI, Yahoo Finance API, or scrape headlines from Google News.

Geopolitical news: Same tools ‚Äî filtered for location (e.g., "China + chip exports").

Sentiment analysis:

Use FinBERT or VADER for scoring news/tweets.

Preprocess with NLP ‚Üí tokenize ‚Üí sentiment score.

python
Copy
Edit
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
score = analyzer.polarity_scores("Company X faces pressure due to new tariffs")
üßπ 3. Feature Engineering
Numerical: Daily returns, volatility, volume

News sentiment scores: Aggregated daily

Insider trade events: Binary or scaled features (e.g., volume/amount)

Geopolitical index: Aggregate weighted score for external risks (e.g., GPR index or manually constructed)

Merge these features into a unified dataframe indexed by date.

ü§ñ 4. Build ML Model (TensorFlow)
Option A: LSTM Model for Time Series Prediction
python
Copy
Edit
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')  # Buy / Hold / Sell
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32)
Option B: Reinforcement Learning Trader
Use TF-Agents or Stable-Baselines3 (TensorFlow-compatible)

Define:

State: stock indicators, news scores, insider trades

Action: Buy, Sell, Hold

Reward: Portfolio return over time

üìä 5. Backtest on Paper Trading
Use paper trading accounts:

Alpaca (Python SDK + free paper trading API)

Integrate via REST API to simulate orders

python
Copy
Edit
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
api = tradeapi.REST(API_KEY, SECRET_KEY, base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets')
api.submit_order(symbol="AAPL", qty=1, side="buy", type="market", time_in_force="gtc")
Track performance: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, CAGR, win rate, etc.

üß™ 6. Monitor and Improve
Retrain model weekly or monthly

Fine-tune sentiment weights

Use Explainable AI (e.g., SHAP) to see which features matter
